# Axial-Staking

This project extends the functionality of the axial-protocol repository to include staking and (soon) fee distribution

Currently the project contains the VestingStake.sol contract and the VestingStake.ts hardhat test script 

The StakingVe contract can be tested as follows:

```shell
npx hardhat test test/VestingStake.ts
```

# Help

Don't forget to set your Solidity compiler version to 0.8.9 and install Hardhat locally.

```shell
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```
